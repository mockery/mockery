# Contributing


We'd love you to help out with mockery and no contribution is too small.


## Reporting Bugs

Issues can be reported on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues). Please try and report any
bugs with a minimal reproducible example, it will make things easier for other
contributors and your problems will hopefully be resolved quickly.


## Requesting Features

We're always interested to hear about your ideas and you can request features by
creating a ticket in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues). We can't always guarantee
someone will jump on it straight away, but putting it out there to see if anyone
else is interested is a good idea.

Likewise, if a feature you would like is already listed in
the issue tracker, add a :+1: so that other contributors know it's a feature
that would help others.


## Contributing code and documentation

We loosely follow the
[PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
and
[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standards,
but we'll probably merge any code that looks close enough.

* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/padraic/mockery) on GitHub
* Add the code for your feature or bug
* Add some tests for your feature or bug
* Optionally, but preferably, write some documentation 
* Optionally, update the CHANGELOG.md file with your feature or
  [BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility) break
* Send a [Pull
  Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the
  correct target branch (see below)

If you have a big change or would like to discuss something, create an issue in
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues) or jump in to
\#mockery on freenode

## Target Branch

Mockery may have several active branches at any one time and roughly follows a
[Git Branching Model](https://igor.io/2013/10/21/git-branching-model.html).
Generally, if you're developing a new feature, you want to be targeting the
master branch, if it's a bug fix, you want to be targeting a release branch,
e.g. 0.8.


## Testing Mockery

To run the unit tests for Mockery, clone the git repository, download Composer using
the instructions at [http://getcomposer.org/download/](http://getcomposer.org/download/),
then install the dependencies with `php /path/to/composer.phar install`.

This will install the required PHPUnit and Hamcrest dev dependencies and create the
autoload files required by the unit tests. You may run the `vendor/bin/phpunit` command
to run the unit tests. If everything goes to plan, there will be no failed tests!


## Debugging Mockery

Mockery and it's code generation can be difficult to debug. A good start is to
use the `RequireLoader`, which will dump the code generated by mockery to a file
before requiring it, rather than using eval. This will help with stack traces,
and you will be able to open the mock class in your editor.

``` php

// tests/bootstrap.php

Mockery::setLoader(new Mockery\Loader\RequireLoader(sys_get_temp_dir()));

```
