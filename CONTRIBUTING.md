# How to contribute

We'd love you to help out with mockery and no contribution is too small. 

## Reporting Bugs

Issues can be reported on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues). Please try and report any
bugs with a minimal reproducible example, it will make things easier for other
contributers and your problems will hopefully be resolved quickly.

## Requesting Features

We're always interested to hear about your ideas and you can request features by
creating a ticket in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues). We can't always guarantee
someone will jump on it straight away, but putting it out there to see if anyone
else is interested is a good idea.

Likewise, if a feature you would like is already listed in
the issue tracker, add a :+1: so that other contributers know it's a feature
that would help others.

## Contributing code and documentation

* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/padraic/mockery) on github.
* Add some tests for your feature or bug
* Add the code for your feature or bug
* Optionally, but preferably, write some documentation (currently in README.md)
* Optionally update the CHANGELOG.md file with your feature or
  [BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility) break
* Send a [Pull
  Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the correct target branch (see below)

If you have a big change or would like to discuss something, create an issue in
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/padraic/mockery/issues) or jump in to
\#mockery on freenode

# Target Branch

Mockery may have several active branches at any one time and roughly follows a
[Git Branching Model](https://igor.io/2013/10/21/git-branching-model.html).
Generally, if you're developing a new feature, you want to be targetting the
master branch, if it's a bug fix, you want to be targetting a release branch,
e.g. 0.8.
