## 1.0.0 (2017-09-06)

- Destructors (`__destruct`) are stubbed out where it makes sense
- Allow passing a closure argument to `withArgs()` to validate multiple arguments at once.
- `Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\TestListener` has been rewritten because it
  incorrectly marked some tests as risky. It will no longer verify mock
  expectations but instead check that tests do that themselves. PHPUnit 6 is
  required if you want to use this fail safe.
- Removes SPL Class Loader
- Removed object recorder feature
- Bumped minimum PHP version to 5.6
- `andThrow` will now throw anything `\Throwable`
- Adds `allows` and `expects` syntax
- Adds optional global helpers for `mock`, `namedMock` and `spy`
- Adds ability to create objects using traits
- `Mockery\Matcher\MustBe` was deprecated
- Marked `Mockery\MockInterface` as internal
- Subset matcher matches recursively
- BC BREAK - Spies return `null` by default from ignored (non-mocked) methods with nullable return type
- Removed extracting getter methods of object instances
- BC BREAK - Remove implicit regex matching when trying to match string arguments, introduce `\Mockery::pattern()` when regex matching is needed
- Fix Mockery not getting closed in cases of failing test cases
- Fix Mockery not setting properties on overloaded instance mocks
- BC BREAK - Fix Mockery not trying default expectations if there is any concrete expectation
- BC BREAK - Mockery's PHPUnit integration will mark a test as risky if it
  thinks one it's exceptions has been swallowed in PHPUnit > 5.7.6. Use `$e->dismiss()` to dismiss.

## 0.9.4 (XXXX-XX-XX)

- `shouldIgnoreMissing` will respect global `allowMockingNonExistentMethods`
  config
- Some support for variadic parameters
- Hamcrest is now a required dependency
- Instance mocks now respect `shouldIgnoreMissing` call on control instance
- This will be the *last version to support PHP 5.3*
- Added `Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\MockeryPHPUnitIntegration` trait
- Added `makePartial` to `Mockery\MockInterface` as it was missing

## 0.9.3 (2014-12-22)

- Added a basic spy implementation
- Added `Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\MockeryTestCase` for more reliable PHPUnit
  integration

## 0.9.2 (2014-09-03)

- Some workarounds for the serialisation problems created by changes to PHP in 5.5.13, 5.4.29,
  5.6.
- Demeter chains attempt to reuse doubles as they see fit, so for foo->bar and
  foo->baz, we'll attempt to use the same foo

## 0.9.1 (2014-05-02)

- Allow specifying consecutive exceptions to be thrown with `andThrowExceptions`
- Allow specifying methods which can be mocked when using
  `Mockery\Configuration::allowMockingNonExistentMethods(false)` with
  `Mockery\MockInterface::shouldAllowMockingMethod($methodName)`
- Added andReturnSelf method: `$mock->shouldReceive("foo")->andReturnSelf()`
- `shouldIgnoreMissing` now takes an optional value that will be return instead
  of null, e.g. `$mock->shouldIgnoreMissing($mock)`

## 0.9.0 (2014-02-05)

- Allow mocking classes with final __wakeup() method
- Quick definitions are now always `byDefault`
- Allow mocking of protected methods with `shouldAllowMockingProtectedMethods`
- Support official Hamcrest package
- Generator completely rewritten
- Easily create named mocks with namedMock
