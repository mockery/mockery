    single: Reserved Method Names

Reserved Method Names
=====================

As you may have noticed, Mockery uses a number of methods called directly on
all mock objects, for example ``shouldReceive()``. Such methods are necessary
in order to setup expectations on the given mock, and so they cannot be
implemented on the classes or objects being mocked without creating a method
name collision (reported as a PHP fatal error). The methods reserved by
Mockery are:

* ``shouldReceive()``
* ``shouldBeStrict()``

In addition, all mocks utilise a set of added methods and protected properties
which cannot exist on the class or object being mocked. These are far less
likely to cause collisions. All properties are prefixed with ``_mockery`` and
all method names with ``mockery_``.
