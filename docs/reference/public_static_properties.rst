Mocking Public Static Methods
=============================

Static methods are not called on real objects, so normal mock objects can't
mock them. Mockery supports class aliased mocks, mocks representing a class
name which would normally be loaded (via autoloading or a require statement)
in the system under test. These aliases block that loading (unless via a
require statement - so please use autoloading!) and allow Mockery to intercept
static method calls and add expectations for them.
