    single: Cookbook; Complex Argument Matching With Mockery::on

Complex Argument Matching With Mockery::on
==========================================

When we need to do a more complex argument matching for an expected method call,
the ``\Mockery::on()`` matcher comes in really handy. It accepts a closure as an
argument and that closure in turn receives the argument passed in to the method,
when called. If the closure returns ``true``, Mockery will consider that the
argument has passed the expectation. If the closure returns ``false``, or a
"falsey" value, the expectation will not pass.

The ``\Mockery::on()`` matcher can be used in various scenarios â€” validating
an array argument based on multiple keys and values, complex string matching...

Say, for example, we have the following code. It doesn't do much; publishes a
post by setting the ``published`` flag in the database to ``1`` and sets the
``published_at`` to the current date and time:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace Service;
    class Post
    {
        public function __construct($model)
        {
            $this->model = $model;
        }

        public function publishPost($id)
        {
            $saveData = [
                'post_id' => $id,
                'published' => 1,
                'published_at' => gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
            ];
            $this->model->save($saveData);
        }
    }

In a test we would mock the model and set some expectations on the call of the
``save()`` method:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    $postId = 42;

    $modelMock = \Mockery::mock('Model');
    $modelMock->shouldReceive('save')
        ->once()
        ->with(\Mockery::on(function ($argument) use ($postId) {
            $postIdIsSet = isset($argument['post_id']) && $argument['post_id'] === $postId;
            $publishedFlagIsSet = isset($argument['published']) && $argument['published'] === 1;
            $publishedAtIsSet = isset($argument['published_at']);

            return $postIdIsSet && $publishedFlagIsSet && $publishedAtIsSet;
        }));

    $service = new \Service\Post($modelMock);
    $service->publishPost($postId);

    \Mockery::close();

The important part of the example is inside the closure we pass to the
``\Mockery::on()`` matcher. The ``$argument`` is actually the ``$saveData`` argument
the ``save()`` method gets when it is called. We check for a couple of things in
this argument:

* the post ID is set, and is same as the post ID we passed in to the
  ``publishPost()`` method,
* the ``published`` flag is set, and is ``1``, and
* the ``published_at`` key is present.

If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the closure will return ``false``,
the method call expectation will not be met, and Mockery will throw a
``NoMatchingExpectationException``.
